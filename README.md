# Simple-Banking-System

The Bank Account Management System is an application for maintaining a person's account in a bank. In this project I tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic functionality of a Bank Account Management System
Talking about the features of the Simple Banking System, a user can create an account by providing the personal details and will get Account Number in return. Existing user can also deposit and withdraw money just by providing the account number and entering the amount. Also, the user can update their details ,check their balance and delete his/her account.This simple console-based system provides the simplest management of bank account and transaction. In short, this project mainly focus on CRUD.

The major modules of this system are as follows:
	User: Class
	Address : Class
	BankingInterface : Interface
	Bank : Class 
	Implementation : Class

Bank class Inherits the User class.
Bank class Implements BankingInterface and override its functions.
Bank class have “Has A relationship(Aggregation)” with Address Class.
Main Function exists in class Implementation.
